A meta-distro - providing a means of building both deb and rpm based custom minimal distributions using standard tools


Description

This 'distro' is intended for people who want to build their own Linux os installations from scratch without using the standard installation process, and without resorting to source builds.

The distro is basically two separate distros - each with routes to a working installation from a trusted source; one RPM based for use on Red-Hat style sources,and the other DEB based for use on Debian style sources.

It is intended that the 'distro'be developed so that both builds can be driven by a common configuration in order to enable uniformity across RPM and DEB based deployments upon installation.
